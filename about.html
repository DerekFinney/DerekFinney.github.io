      <p id="swamp">Swamp House contains two rooms. As you enter you'll come across the main room, which functions as both a kitchen and dining room. There is also a bed for the Ogre Triplets. And the west of the main room is Shrek and Fiona's bedroom. In Rumpelstiltskin's universe there is no furniture in the house because it is just an empty tree stump with no doors</p>
